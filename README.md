INTRODUCING MYSELF

Hello GitHub!
if you found my page it's probabily because this is where i keep the files for my minecraft mods.

You're not here for that? how strange
maybe you're looking for Open Source code right?

Not even that?
well you're not getting your hands on the MinMax engine and the crash handler.

Still not that?
you've mistaken me for someone else. That's all the content you'll find here.
